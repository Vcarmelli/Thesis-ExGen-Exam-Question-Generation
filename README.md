_An Innovative Web-based System Approach to Automated Examination Design Using Retrieval-augmented Generation and Large Language Models_


**EXGEN** is a web-based system designed to automate and enhance the process of creating educational assessments using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. It aims to streamline the time-consuming task of creating effective and diverse exam questions for educators. The system also provides keynotes generation to aid students in their review process.



## Features

*   **AI-Powered Question Generation**: Utilizes a **LLaMA 3 language model** combined with ChromaDB for contextual storage and retrieval to generate diverse question types.
*   **Bloom's Taxonomy Integration**: Incorporates Bloomâ€™s Taxonomy (Remembering, Understanding, Applying, Analyzing, Evaluating, Creating) to ensure cognitive depth and variation in generated questions, aligning with target order of thinking skills.
*   **Question Types**: Generates Multiple-Choice, True/False, Identification/Short Answer, Essay, and Situation-based Questions.
*   **Key Notes Generation**: Allows users to generate study key notes from uploaded materials, including learning objectives, overview, summary, key terms and definitions, and tips.
*   **Flexible Content Upload**: Users can upload course materials in PDF format, select specific sections or pages to focus on, and set limits on the number of questions generated.
*   **Question Management**: Educators can view generated questions with answers, modify them as needed, and delete questions they prefer to exclude.
*   **Export Functionality**: Enables users to export generated questions and key notes in Word or PDF format for immediate use.
*   **Library Feature**: Includes a library to access previously saved questions and key notes for convenience and future reference.

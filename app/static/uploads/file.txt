The	goal	in	any	sport	is	to	finish	with	the	best	score,	but	it	would	be	ridiculous
to	spend	the	whole	game	staring	at	the	scoreboard.	The	only	way	to	actually	win
is	to	get	better	each	day.	In	the	words	of	three-time	Super	Bowl	winner	Bill
Walsh,	“The	score	takes	care	of	itself.”	The	same	is	true	for	other	areas	of	life.	If
you	want	better	results,	then	forget	about	setting	goals.	Focus	on	your	system
instead.
What	do	I	mean	by	this?	Are	goals	completely	useless?	Of	course	not.	Goals
are	good	for	setting	a	direction,	but	systems	are	best	for	making	progress.	A
handful	of	problems	arise	when	you	spend	too	much	time	thinking	about	your
goals	and	not	enough	time	designing	your	systems.
Problem	#1:	Winners	and	losers	have	the	same	goals.
Goal	setting	suffers	from	a	serious	case	of	survivorship	bias.	We	concentrate	on
the	people	who	end	up	winning—the	survivors—and	
mistakenly	assume	that
ambitious	goals	led	to	their	success	while	overlooking	all	of	the	people	who	had
the	same	objective	but	didn’t	succeed.
Every	Olympian	wants	to	win	a	gold	medal.	Every	candidate	wants	to	get	the
job.	And	if	successful	and	unsuccessful	people	share	the	same	goals,	then	
the
goal	cannot	be	what	differentiates	the	winners	from	the	losers.	It	wasn’t	the	
goal
of	winning	the	Tour	de	France	that	propelled	the	British	cyclists	to	the	top	of	the
sport.	Presumably,	they	had	wanted	to	win	the	race	every	year	before—just	like
every	other	professional	team.	The	goal	had	always	been	there.	It	was	only	when
they	implemented	a	
system
	of	continuous	small	improvements	that	they	achieved
a	different	outcome.
Problem	#2:	Achieving	a	goal	is	only	a	momentary	change.
Imagine	you	have	a	messy	room	and	you	set	a	goal	to	clean	it.	If	you	summon
the	energy	to	tidy	up,	then	you	will	have	a	clean	room—for	now.	But	if	you
maintain	the	same	sloppy,	pack-rat	habits	that	led	to	a	messy	room	in	the	first
place,	soon	you’ll	be	looking	at	a	new	pile	of	clutter	and	hoping	for	another	burst
of	motivation.	You’re	left	chasing	the	same	outcome	because	you	never	changed
the	system	behind	it.	You	treated	a	symptom	without	addressing	the	cause.
Achieving	a	goal	only	changes	your	life	
for	 the	 moment
.	That’s	the
counterintuitive	thing	about	improvement.	We	think	we	need	to	change	our
results,	but	the	results	are	not	the	problem.	What	we	really	need	to	change	are
the	systems	that	cause	those	results.	When	you	solve	problems	at	the	results level,	you	only	solve	them	temporarily.	In	order	to	improve	for	good,	you	need
to	solve	problems	at	the	systems	level.	Fix	the	inputs	and	the	outputs	will	fix
themselves.
Problem	#3:	Goals	restrict	your	happiness.
The	implicit	assumption	behind	any	goal	is	this:	“Once	I	reach	my	goal,	then	I’ll
be	happy.”	The	problem	with	a	goals-first	mentality	is	that	you’re	continually
putting	happiness	off	until	the	next	milestone.	I’ve	slipped	into	this	trap	so	many
times	I’ve	lost	count.	For	years,	happiness	was	always	something	for	my	future
self	to	enjoy.	I	promised	myself	that	once	I	gained	twenty	pounds	of	muscle	or
after	my	business	was	featured	in	the	
New	York	Times
,	then	I	could	finally	relax.
Furthermore,	goals	create	an	“either-or”	conflict:	either	you	achieve	your	goal
and	are	successful	or	you	fail	and	you	are	a	disappointment.	You	mentally	box
yourself	into	a	narrow	version	of	happiness.	This	is	misguided.	It	is	unlikely	that
your	actual	path	through	life	will	match	the	exact	journey	you	had	in	mind	when
you	set	out.	It	makes	no	sense	to	restrict	your	satisfaction	to	one	scenario	when
there	are	many	paths	to	success.
A	systems-first	mentality	provides	the	antidote.	When	you	fall	in	love	with	the
process	rather	than	the	product,	you	don’t	have	to	wait	to	give	yourself
permission	to	be	happy.	You	can	be	satisfied	anytime	your	system	is	running.
And	a	system	can	be	successful	in	many	different	forms,	not	just	the	one	you
first	envision.
Problem	#4:	Goals	are	at	odds	with	long-term	progress.
Finally,	a	goal-oriented	mind-set	can	create	a	“yo-yo”	effect.	Many	runners	work
hard	for	months,	but	as	soon	as	they	cross	the	finish	line,	they	stop	training.	The
race	is	no	longer	there	to	motivate	them.	When	all	of	your	hard	work	is	focused
on	a	particular	goal,	what	is	left	to	push	you	forward	after	you	achieve	it?	This	is
why	 many	 people	 find	 themselves	 reverting	 to	 their	 old	 habits	 after
accomplishing	a	goal.
The	purpose	of	setting	goals	is	to	win	the	game.	The	purpose	of	building
systems	is	to	continue	playing	the	game.	True	long-term	thinking	is	goal-less
thinking.	It’s	not	about	any	single	accomplishment.	It	is	about	the	cycle	of
endless	 refinement	 and	 continuous	 improvement.	 Ultimately,	 it	 is	 your
commitment	to	the	
process
	that	will	determine	your	
progress
.

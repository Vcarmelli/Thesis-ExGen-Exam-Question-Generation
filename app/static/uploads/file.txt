“I’m	terrible	with	directions.”
“I’m	not	a	morning	person.”
“I’m	bad	at	remembering	people’s	names.”
“I’m	always	late.”
“I’m	not	good	with	technology.”
“I’m	horrible	at	math.”
.	.	.	and	a	thousand	other	variations.
When	you	have	repeated	a	story	to	yourself	for	years,	it	is	easy	to	slide	into
these	mental	grooves	and	accept	them	as	a	fact.	In	time,	you	begin	to	resist
certain	actions	because	“that’s	not	who	I	am.”	
There	is	internal	pressure	to
maintain	your	self-image	and	behave	in	a	way	that	is	consistent	with	your
beliefs.	You	find	whatever	way	you	can	to	avoid	contradicting	yourself.
The	more	deeply	a	thought	or	action	is	tied	to	your	identity,	the	more	difficult
it	is	to	change	it.	It	can	feel	comfortable	to	believe	what	your	culture	believes
(group	identity)	or	to	do	what	upholds	your	self-image	(personal	identity),	even
if	it’s	wrong.	The	biggest	barrier	to	positive	change	at	any	level—individual,
team,	society—is	identity	conflict.	Good	habits	can	make	rational	sense,	but	if
they	conflict	with	your	identity,	you	will	fail	to	put	them	into	action.
On	any	given	day,	you	may	struggle	with	your	habits	because	you’re	too	busy
or	too	tired	or	too	overwhelmed	or	hundreds	of	other	reasons.	Over	the	long	run,
however,	the	real	reason	you	fail	to	stick	with	habits	is	that	your	self-image	gets
in	the	way.	This	is	why	you	can’t	get	too	attached	to	one	version	of	your
identity.	Progress	requires	unlearning.	Becoming	the	best	version	of	yourself
requires	you	to	continuously	edit	your	beliefs,	and	to	upgrade	and	expand	your
identity.
This	brings	us	to	an	important	question:	If	your	beliefs	and	worldview	play
such	an	important	role	in	your	behavior,	where	do	they	come	from	in	the	first
place?	How,	exactly,	is	your	identity	formed?	And	how	can	you	emphasize	new
aspects	of	your	identity	that	serve	you	and	gradually	erase	the	pieces	that	hinder
you?
THE	TWO-STEP	PROCESS	TO	CHANGING	YOUR	IDENTITY
Your	identity	emerges	out	of	your	habits.	You	are	not	born	with	preset	beliefs.
Every	belief,	including	those	about	yourself,	is	learned	and	conditioned	through
experience.
* More	precisely,	your	habits	are	how	you	
embody
	your	identity.	When	you
make	your	bed	each	day,	you	embody	the	identity	of	an	organized	person.	When
you	write	each	day,	you	embody	the	identity	of	a	creative	person.	When	you
train	each	day,	you	embody	the	identity	of	an	athletic	person.
The	more	you	repeat	a	behavior,	the	more	you	reinforce	the	identity
associated	with	that	behavior.	In	fact,	the	word	
identity
	was	originally	derived
from	the	Latin	words	
essentitas
,	which	means	
being,
	and	
identidem
,	which
means	
repeatedly
.	
Your	identity	is	literally	your	“repeated	beingness.”
Whatever	your	identity	is	right	now,	you	only	believe	it	because	you	have
proof	of	it.	If	you	go	to	church	every	Sunday	for	twenty	years,	you	have
evidence	that	you	are	religious.	If	you	study	biology	for	one	hour	every	night,
you	have	evidence	that	you	are	studious.	If	you	go	to	the	gym	even	when	it’s
snowing,	you	have	evidence	that	you	are	committed	to	fitness.	The	more
evidence	you	have	for	a	belief,	the	more	strongly	you	will	believe	it.
For	most	of	my	early	life,	I	didn’t	consider	myself	a	writer.	If	you	were	to	ask
any	of	my	high	school	teachers	or	college	professors,	they	would	tell	you	I	was
an	average	writer	at	best:	certainly	not	a	standout.	When	I	began	my	writing
career,	I	published	a	new	article	every	Monday	and	Thursday	for	the	first	few
years.	As	the	evidence	grew,	so	did	my	identity	as	a	writer.	I	didn’t	start	out	as	a
writer.	I	
became
	one	through	my	habits.
Of	course,	your	habits	are	not	the	
only
	actions	that	influence	your	identity,	but
by	virtue	of	their	frequency	they	are	usually	the	most	important	ones.	Each
experience	in	life	modifies	your	self-image,	but	it’s	unlikely	you	would	consider
yourself	a	soccer	player	because	you	kicked	a	ball	once	or	an	artist	because	you
scribbled	a	picture.	As	you	repeat	these	actions,	however,	the	evidence
accumulates	and	your	self-image	begins	to	change.	The	effect	of	one-off
experiences	tends	to	fade	away	while	the	effect	of	habits	gets	reinforced	with
time,	which	means	your	habits	contribute	most	of	the	evidence	that	shapes	your
identity.	In	this	way,	the	process	of	building	habits	is	actually	the	process	of
becoming	yourself.
This	is	a	gradual	evolution.	We	do	not	change	by	snapping	our	
fingers	and
deciding	to	be	someone	entirely	new.	
We	change	bit	by	bit,	day	by	day,	habit	by
habit.	We	are	continually	undergoing	microevolutions	of	the	self.
Each	habit	is	like	a	suggestion:	“Hey,	maybe	
this
	is	who	I	am.”	If	you	finish	a
book,	then	perhaps	you	are	the	type	of	person	who	likes	reading.	If	you	go	to	the
gym,	then	perhaps	you	are	the	type	of	person	who	likes	exercise.	If	you	practice
playing	the	guitar,	perhaps	you	are	the	type	of	person	who	likes	music.
Every	action	you	take	is	a	vote	for	the	type	of	person	you	wish	to	become.	No
single	instance	will	transform	your	beliefs,	but	as	the	votes	build	up,	so	does	the
